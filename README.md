My final project for hackbright will be a webapp augumented reality game 

users can create many games 
users can have many games running (sessions)
users must complete first game before they are allowed to creat their own games

games have multiple challenges 

each challenge has
	a game id which ties to the game database

	a challenge position - which denotes how far 
	along you are in the game 

	a story - which will be engaging to make the 
	players want to keep playing 

	a puzzle - some sort of riddle, puzzle, search, 
	or location based challenge that will unlock 
	coordinates that will progress the game forward 

	a solution - this will check the user input for 
	the correct answer and if it is correct it will 
	show gps coordinates 

	latitude / longitude will access google maps for 
	people to check in and if they are with in 30 meters 
	of the location will progress the game one more step
